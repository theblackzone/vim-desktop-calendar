# vim-desktop-calendar

This project is a continuation of the classic Vim Desktop Calendar originally
created and published by Bram Moolenaar on his
[homepage](https://www.moolenaar.net/).

The Vim Desktop Calendar is a printable, foldable calendar designed to fit on a
single DIN A4 sheet. Once assembled, it sits neatly on your desk as a year-long
companion. The front features a practical 12-month calendar, while the back
includes brief information about the Vim editor and the ICCF—a charitable
foundation supporting orphans in Uganda.

My goal was to recreate these calendars as faithfully as possible to Bram’s
originals. While they may not be pixel-perfect, they come very close.

Unlike Bram’s tradition of offering both Dutch and English versions, this
project provides the calendar in English only.
